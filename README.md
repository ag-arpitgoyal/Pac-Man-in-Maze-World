# Pac-Man-in-Maze-World
A Python-based navigation system for Pac-Man, where he must traverse a 2D grid maze while avoiding ghosts. This project utilizes stack-based algorithms for pathfinding and includes classes for managing the maze and ghost interactions. Designed as part of a data structures assignment (COL106), it showcases efficient maze traversal techniques.
